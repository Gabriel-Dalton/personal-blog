<p>Innovation cycles are compressing. What once took a decade now happens in a few short years. The winners will be the ones who learn faster, ship smaller, and iterate with care.</p>
<p>Three principles guide my thinking:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Build for clarity: make the value obvious.</li>
  <li>Architect for change: expect requirements to evolve.</li>
  <li>Respect energy: create systems that do more with less.</li>
  </ul>
